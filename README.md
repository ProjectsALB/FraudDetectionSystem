Fraud Detection System (SQL Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Fraud Detection System entirely in SQL.
It focuses on database design, data integrity, and analytical queries to detect suspicious financial transactions.

The system simulates transaction data and applies SQL logic to identify potential fraud patterns using queries, triggers, stored procedures, and indexing strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Design a relational database for transaction monitoring

Implement data integrity using constraints and triggers

Detect suspicious transactions using advanced SQL queries

Optimize performance using indexes

Apply stored procedures for automated fraud checks

🗂 Database Design

The project includes:

ER Diagram (Entity-Relationship Model)

Relational Schema

Primary and Foreign Keys

Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, etc.)

Indexes for performance optimization

Example entities may include:

Users

Accounts

Transactions

Fraud_Alerts

⚙️ Features

✅ Transaction recording system

✅ Fraud detection rules (e.g., large transactions, unusual frequency)

✅ Stored Procedures for fraud analysis

✅ Triggers for automatic validation

✅ Indexing for faster query execution

✅ Analytical queries for reporting suspicious activity

🔎 Fraud Detection Logic

The system identifies suspicious behavior such as:

Transactions exceeding a specific amount

Multiple transactions in a short time period

Unusual activity patterns per account

Transactions flagged based on predefined business rules

All detection logic is implemented directly in SQL.

🛠 Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server — specify yours)

Relational Database Design

ER Modeling

🚀 How to Run the Project

Create a new database.

Execute the schema creation script.

Insert sample data.

Run stored procedures or analytical queries to detect fraud.

Review flagged transactions in the results.

📊 Learning Outcomes
